## 👋 Hi, I’m Martin

I’m a **Software Engineering graduate and Full Stack Developer** with professional experience building and maintaining production web applications. My background is primarily in **PHP and JavaScript**, working across backend and frontend systems with SQL databases, and frameworks such as **Laravel** and **Vue**.

I enjoy working on real-world systems — extending existing codebases, improving reliability, and delivering features that align with actual user and business needs. I’m comfortable navigating both legacy and modern stacks, collaborating in agile teams, and learning new technologies where they add value.

Alongside my professional work, I maintain personal projects focused on:
- full-stack web development  
- game-related systems and simulations  
- strengthening core software engineering fundamentals  

I value clean, maintainable code, clear communication, and continuous improvement. I am currently **based in Germany** and open to **full-stack or backend-focused roles** in collaborative, product-driven teams.
