Graduate from the University of Portsmouth. Have used skills in React and Node.js to deploy web applications using Google web services. Further experience includes using project management tools such as Jira and DevOps in a team environment. 

For third year my modules included Robotics, Scalable Software Engineering, Engineering Science and Neural Networks. 

For my dissertation I have created a customisable and configurable vehicle web interface for Raspberry Pi, with the goal that it can be used as an educational or hobbyist tool. I have used React and Node.js in this project.

My future goals include improving my skillset with an aim of becoming a full stack developer in the near future.
